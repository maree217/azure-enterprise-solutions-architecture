## Sarah Chen - Director of Building Safety

**Role Context:** Principal Accountable Person for all 47 high-rise buildings. Personally liable under Building Safety Act 2022.

### Strategic Priorities

> "My number one priority is keeping residents safe and demonstrating to the regulator that we're in control. Right now, I can't honestly say I have complete confidence in our compliance status."

| Priority | Urgency | Current Confidence |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Building Safety Act compliance | Critical | Low |
| Golden thread implementation | Critical | Very Low |
| Resident engagement | High | Low |
| Operational efficiency | Medium | Medium |

### Key Pain Points

**1. Personal Liability Fear**
> "I wake up at night worrying about what I don't know. The Building Safety Act makes me personally liable, but I don't have visibility of our true position. That's terrifying."

**2. Information Fragmentation**
> "When the Building Safety Regulator asks for information, I have to get five different teams to search five different systems. It takes days, and I'm never confident we've got everything."

**3. Lack of Single View**
> "I don't have a dashboard that tells me: these are our 47 buildings, this is their compliance status, these are the risks. I'm flying blind."

### Vision for Future State

> "I want to log in Monday morning and see a traffic light dashboard. Green - we're compliant. Amber - action needed. Red - immediate attention. And I want to drill down to any building and see everything: certificates, FRAs, works, resident feedback. One system. One truth."

### Success Criteria

| Criterion | Measure |
|-----------|---------|
| Building Safety Cases | 47/47 complete |
| Regulator response time | Same day |
| Personal confidence | "I know we're safe" |
| Board assurance | Quarterly dashboard |

## Marcus Williams - Building Safety Manager

**Role Context:** Day-to-day management of building safety compliance across all stock. Reports to Sarah Chen.

### Current Challenges

> "I spend 60% of my time chasing information, 30% putting out fires, and maybe 10% actually improving safety. That ratio is completely wrong."

**1. Reactive Management**
> "We're always reacting. A certificate expires, we scramble. An FRA action is overdue, we panic. There's no time for proactive safety improvement."

**2. Multiple System Logins**
> "I have logins for Northgate, Keystone, Promaster, Gas-Track, plus various spreadsheets. Every day I'm copying and pasting between systems."

**3. Action Tracking**
> "FRA actions are in Keystone, but the work orders are in Northgate, and the evidence is in SharePoint. Tracking an action from identification to completion is a manual nightmare."

### Process Pain Points

| Process | Current Time | Desired Time |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Building compliance status check | 2-3 hours | 5 minutes |
| FRA action follow-up | 30 mins each | Automated |
| Certificate expiry tracking | Daily spreadsheet | Automated alerts |
| Regulator report compilation | 3-5 days | 1 hour |

### Vision for Future State

> "I want one system where I can see all compliance for a building in one view. I want to be notified before things become urgent. I want to spend my time on safety improvements, not data hunting."

---

## Priya Patel - Housing Officer

**Role Context:** Primary contact for residents. Handles queries about property, tenancy, and increasingly, building safety.

### Current Experience

> "Residents call me asking about gas safety certificates, electrical tests, fire safety. I can't answer them. I have to say 'I'll get back to you' and then chase three different teams."

**1. Resident Query Handling**
> "A resident called last week worried about cladding on their building. I couldn't tell them anything definitive. I had to email Building Safety, wait two days, and then relay a vague answer."

**2. Information Access**
> "I can see their tenancy in Northgate, but nothing about building safety. If they ask about their flat's gas certificate, I have to call the repairs team."

**3. Trust Erosion**
> "Residents are losing trust in us. They see the news about building safety, they're worried, and we can't give them reassurance or information."

### What Would Help

| Need | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Building safety view | See compliance status for any building |
| Certificate lookup | Find certificates for specific properties |
| Resident FAQ | Common questions with answers |
| Escalation path | Clear route for urgent concerns |

### Quote

> "If I could pull up a building and see 'gas: compliant, electrical: compliant, FRA: in progress' - I could actually help residents instead of passing them around."

## David Okonkwo - Compliance Surveyor

**Role Context:** Conducts compliance inspections across the stock. Primarily fire safety, but covers other areas as needed.

### Current Working Day

> "I arrive at site, do my inspection, take photos on my phone, make notes on paper, then drive back to the office and spend an hour typing it all up. It's ridiculous."

**1. No Mobile Tools**
> "I'm using a £1,000 phone to take photos that I then email to myself and manually attach to records. There must be a better way."

**2. Paper-Based Forms**
> "I've got a pad of inspection forms. I fill them in on site, then transcribe to the system later. Sometimes days later if I'm busy."

**3. No Offline Capability**
> "Some of our buildings have no phone signal in basements and plant rooms. I can't access any systems even if we had mobile apps."

### What Would Transform the Role

| Capability | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Mobile app | Complete inspections on device |
| Offline mode | Work in signal-poor areas |
| Photo capture with auto-attach | No manual photo handling |
| GPS location | Prove attendance |
| Digital signature | Resident sign-off on site |

### Quote

> "Give me an app that works offline, lets me do my inspection, take photos, get it signed, and syncs when I'm back in range. I'd be twice as productive and the data would be instant."

## Emma Thompson - Resident (Tower 3)

**Role Context:** Resident in a high-rise building (18+ floors). Leaseholder. Concerned about building safety since Grenfell.

### Resident Perspective

> "I live on the 14th floor. Every time I hear about building safety in the news, I worry. Is my building safe? What inspections have been done? I have no idea."

**1. Information Vacuum**
> "I get occasional letters about 'essential works' but no context. Is this normal maintenance or are they fixing something dangerous?"

**2. No Digital Access**
> "I can pay my service charge online, but I can't see what safety works have been done in my building. Seems backwards."

**3. Trust Deficit**
> "I don't distrust Meridian specifically, but after Grenfell, residents across the country lost trust in housing providers. Transparency would help rebuild that."

### What Residents Want

| Need | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Building safety summary | "Is my building safe?" - simple answer |
| Works transparency | What's being done, when, why |
| Certificate visibility | Evidence of compliance |
| Feedback mechanism | Way to report concerns digitally |
| Progress updates | Notification when safety works complete |

### Quote

> "I don't expect to be a building safety expert. But I want to see that Meridian is on top of it. Show me the fire risk assessment is current. Show me the gas checks are done. Then I can sleep at night."

---

## James Morton - IT Manager

**Role Context:** Responsible for all IT systems including Northgate. Manages relationship with vendors.

### Current State Assessment

> "Our systems were never designed to work together. Northgate for housing, Keystone for fire, Promaster for asbestos - they're all silos. We've talked about integration for years but never had budget or business case."

**1. Integration Challenges**
> "Every time we try to get data from one system to another, it's a project. There's no integration layer, no API strategy, nothing."

**2. Shadow IT**
> "The compliance team has spreadsheets everywhere because the systems don't give them what they need. That's shadow IT and it's a risk."

**3. Skills Gap**
> "My team knows Northgate and M365. We don't have Azure or data platform skills. Any new platform will need external support initially."

### Technical Recommendations

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Integration | "Build an integration layer - don't point-to-point" |
| Data | "Create a data warehouse that brings it all together" |
| Northgate | "Keep it as the core HMS, don't replace it" |
| Support model | "Cloud services we can't support in-house initially" |

### Concerns

> "My concern is we build something amazing and then can't support it. I need a clear support model and skills transfer plan."

## Perception vs Reality Matrix

Based on stakeholder interviews:

| Area | Stakeholder Perception | Reality Found |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Compliance Status** | "We're mostly compliant" | 26% BSCs complete, 78% gas, 82% FRAs |
| **Data Location** | "It's all in Northgate" | 8+ systems, 50+ spreadsheets |
| **Integration** | "Systems can talk" | No integration, manual transfer |
| **Mobile Capability** | "We need reports" | Need mobile apps for field |
| **Resident Engagement** | "Letters are fine" | Digital engagement required by BSA |
| **Staff Efficiency** | "Need more people" | Need better tools, not more staff |

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: Visibility Gap
Every stakeholder expressed frustration at not being able to see a complete picture. From Sarah's "flying blind" to Emma's "information vacuum" - visibility is the core need.

### Theme 2: Integration Debt
Years of buying point solutions without integration strategy has created massive technical debt. Data exists but cannot be unified.

### Theme 3: Mobile as Enabler
Field workers are constrained by paper processes. Mobile capability would transform productivity and data timeliness.

### Theme 4: Trust Restoration
Both internal (Sarah's personal liability concerns) and external (Emma's resident trust) stakeholders need confidence through transparency.

### Theme 5: Process Before Technology
Marcus's "60% chasing information" highlights that technology must serve process improvement, not just digitise broken processes.
