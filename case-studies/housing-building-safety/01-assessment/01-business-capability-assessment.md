# Business Capability Assessment

## Meridian Housing Group

*Assessment conducted following the [Assessment Toolkit Interview Guide](../../../assessment-toolkit/methodology/interview-guide.md) with Building Safety Act-specific adaptations.*

---

## Executive Summary

Meridian Housing Group faces a critical compliance challenge. Despite significant investment in individual compliance systems, the organisation lacks a unified view of building safety across its 47 high-rise buildings. The Building Safety Act 2022 has elevated this from an operational inconvenience to a regulatory and personal liability risk for senior leaders.

## Business Pain Points

### 1. Data Fragmentation (Critical)

**Problem:** Compliance data exists across 8+ disconnected systems with no single source of truth.

**Impact:**
- Staff spend hours searching multiple systems
- Conflicting information between systems
- No confidence in compliance status
- Regulator requests require manual collation

**Quote from Sarah Chen (Director of Building Safety):**
> "When the Building Safety Regulator asks for information about one of our high-rises, I have to get people from five different teams to pull data from their systems. It takes days, and I'm never confident we've got everything."

### 2. Reactive Compliance Management (High)

**Problem:** Compliance is managed reactively through certificate expiry dates, not proactively through risk-based prioritisation.

**Impact:**
- Last-minute scrambles for expiring certificates
- No visibility of emerging risks
- Resources not allocated to highest-risk areas
- Resident complaints about access for inspections

**Quote from Marcus Williams (Building Safety Manager):**
> "We're always chasing our tails. A certificate expires, we panic, we sort it. But we should be planning this months ahead based on actual risk, not just dates."

### 3. No Golden Thread (Critical)

**Problem:** The Building Safety Act requires a "golden thread" of building information. Meridian cannot demonstrate this currently.

**Impact:**
- Cannot complete Building Safety Cases
- No audit trail of changes
- Documents scattered across SharePoint, network drives, and email
- Risk of regulatory enforcement

**Quote from Sarah Chen:**
> "If the regulator asked me today to show the golden thread for Tower 7, I couldn't do it. That terrifies me."

### 4. Manual Processes Everywhere (High)

**Problem:** Critical compliance processes depend on manual data entry, spreadsheets, and individual knowledge.

**Impact:**
- Key-person dependency
- Transcription errors
- No process auditability
- Inefficient use of skilled staff

**Quote from Priya Patel (Housing Officer):**
> "I've got a spreadsheet I update every day with gas certificate dates. If I'm off sick, no one else knows how to use it."

### 5. No Resident Visibility (Medium)

**Problem:** Residents have no digital access to building safety information or works progress.

**Impact:**
- Phone calls and complaints about access
- No mechanism for resident feedback
- Trust deficit with residents
- Cannot demonstrate resident engagement for Building Safety Act

**Quote from Emma Thompson (Resident - Tower 3):**
> "I have no idea what safety work has been done in my building. I get letters occasionally, but I've got no way to check or ask questions online."

## Building Safety Act Compliance Gaps

### Golden Thread Requirements

| Requirement | Current State | Gap Description |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Structural Information** | Paper drawings, some CAD | Not digitised, not version controlled |
| **Fire Safety Information** | Keystone system (partial) | Not linked to building record |
| **As-Built Drawings** | Varies by building | Many buildings have incomplete records |
| **Change History** | Not maintained | No audit trail of modifications |
| **Handover Information** | Filing cabinets | Not accessible or searchable |

### Building Safety Case Requirements

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|

| Management strategy | Not documented | Implicit in operations |
| Mandatory occurrence reporting process | Ad-hoc | No defined workflow |

### Accountable Person Duties

| Duty | Current Capability | Gap |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Assess building safety risks | Limited - reactive FRAs | Proactive risk assessment needed |
| Prevent occurrence of building safety risks | Limited visibility | Predictive capability needed |
| Reduce severity of incidents | Response procedures exist | Digital incident management needed |
| Provide information to residents | Letters only | Digital engagement needed |
| Provide information to regulator | Manual collation | Automated reporting needed |

## Recommendations

Based on this business capability assessment:

1. **Proceed with Building Safety Compliance Platform** - The regulatory imperative is clear, the business case is compelling, and the risk of inaction is unacceptable.

2. **Prioritise Golden Thread** - This is the foundation for Building Safety Act compliance and enables all other capabilities.

3. **Integrate, Don't Replace** - Build around Northgate, unify the compliance systems, don't create another silo.

4. **Mobile-First for Field Workers** - Surveyor adoption is critical for data quality and efficiency.

5. **Residents as Stakeholders** - Digital engagement is a regulatory requirement and a trust-building opportunity.
