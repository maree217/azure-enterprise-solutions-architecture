# Assessment Phase

## Overview

The assessment phase established the foundation for Meridian Housing Group's transformation. Over 4-6 weeks, we conducted a comprehensive discovery that shaped every subsequent technical decision.

> **Methodology:** This assessment followed the [Assessment Toolkit](../../../assessment-toolkit/) methodology with housing-specific adaptations for Building Safety Act compliance.

## Assessment Documents

| Document | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| [Business Capability Assessment](01-business-capability-assessment.md) | KPIs, pain points, compliance gaps | Executives, Business Sponsors |
| [Technology Architecture Assessment](02-technology-architecture-assessment.md) | Data, Application, Process architecture | Architects, IT Leadership |

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Gaps Identified

| Gap Category | Finding | Severity |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Data Fragmentation** | Compliance data across 8+ disconnected systems | Critical |
| **Golden Thread** | Only 35% of required building information digitally available | Critical |
| **Manual Processes** | 3-5 days to collate building information for regulators | High |
| **Mobile Capability** | No mobile tools for field surveyors | High |
| **Resident Engagement** | No digital channel for resident safety communication | Medium |

### Perception vs Reality

| Area | What Meridian Believed | What We Found |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Compliance Status** | "We're mostly compliant" | 26% Building Safety Cases complete |
| **Data Quality** | "Data is in Northgate" | Critical data in 8 separate systems |
| **Staff Efficiency** | "Just need better reports" | Fundamental process and data issues |
| **Integration** | "Systems can talk to each other" | Manual exports and re-keying prevalent |

---

## Toolkit Integration

Throughout this assessment, we referenced and adapted the following toolkit components:

| Toolkit Component | How Used |
|-------------------|----------|
| [Interview Guide](../../../assessment-toolkit/methodology/interview-guide.md) | Structured stakeholder conversations |
| [Discovery Checklist](../../../assessment-toolkit/methodology/discovery-checklist.md) | Access verification and documentation collection |
| [Gap Analysis Template](../../../assessment-toolkit/analysis-templates/gap-analysis-template.md) | Structured findings documentation |
| [Three-Layer Classification](../../../assessment-toolkit/analysis-templates/three-layer-classification.md) | System categorisation framework |
| [WAF Scorecard](../../../assessment-toolkit/analysis-templates/waf-scorecard.md) | Architecture maturity assessment |

## Assessment Timeline

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Discovery kickoff, stakeholder identification, access provisioning | Stakeholder map, access confirmed |
| **Week 2** | Executive interviews, business capability assessment | Business assessment draft |
| **Week 2-3** | Technical architecture assessment, systems mapping | Technology assessment draft |
| **Week 3-4** | Deep data extraction, M365 and Northgate analysis | Data extraction report |
| **Week 5** | Gap analysis, findings consolidation | Gap analysis document |
| **Week 6** | Roadmap development, stakeholder presentation | Agreed roadmap |

---

## Next Steps

The assessment phase concluded with a clear understanding of:

1. **Business priorities** - Building Safety Act compliance as primary driver
2. **Technical landscape** - Northgate as core HMS, 6+ compliance systems requiring integration
3. **Data quality** - Significant gaps in golden thread information
4. **Process inefficiencies** - Manual, reactive compliance management
5. **User needs** - Mobile for surveyors, portal for residents, dashboard for executives

This understanding directly shaped the [Architecture](../02-architecture/) decisions that followed.
