## Stakeholder Quotes

### Sarah Chen - Director of Building Safety

> "For the first time since the Building Safety Act came in, I can sleep at night. I log in, see green across our high-rise buildings, and know we're compliant. When the regulator asks for information, we have it in minutes, not days. The personal liability that kept me awake now feels manageable."

### Marcus Williams - Building Safety Manager

> "I've gone from spending 60% of my time chasing information to spending 70% on actually improving safety. The dashboards tell me what needs attention. The alerts tell me before things become urgent. This is how it should have always been."

### Priya Patel - Housing Officer

> "When a resident calls about their building's fire safety, I can actually help them now. I pull up the building, see the FRA is current, see the actions that are being worked on, and give them real information. They trust us more because we can be transparent."

### David Okonkwo - Compliance Surveyor

> "The mobile app changed everything. I do an inspection, take photos, get a signature, and it's done. No driving back to the office, no typing up notes. I'm doing twice as many inspections and the data is instant. And it works in basements - that was crucial."

### Emma Thompson - Resident (Tower 3)

> "I was sceptical when they said we could see our building's safety status online. But it's actually reassuring. I can see the fire assessment was done recently, I can see they're replacing fire doors. It's not perfect, but at least I know what's happening."

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

| Area | Success Factor |
|------|----------------|
| **Executive sponsorship** | Sarah Chen's active involvement drove adoption |
| **Data-first approach** | Building Layer 2 before Layer 1 meant apps had good data |
| **Champion network** | Floor walking in first weeks critical for support |
| **Mobile-first field** | Surveyors embraced app immediately |
| **Quick wins** | Executive dashboard early built momentum |

### What Could Improve

| Area | Learning |
|------|----------|
| **Data quality** | Should have started UPRN remediation earlier |
| **Resident adoption** | Need more promotion, simpler registration |
| **Keystone integration** | Legacy system integration harder than expected |
| **Training timing** | Should have been closer to go-live |
| **Document migration** | More documents than expected, ongoing backlog |

### Recommendations for Others

1. **Start with data quality** - Fix data issues before building applications
2. **Invest in change management** - Technology is 30% of the challenge
3. **Get executive visible sponsorship** - Director-level messages matter
4. **Pilot with enthusiasts** - Early adopters become champions
5. **Plan for legacy systems** - Integration is always harder than expected
6. **Don't underestimate documents** - Golden thread is a multi-year journey
